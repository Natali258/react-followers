A place of happy people app
Welcome to a place of happy people! This web application allows you to view tweets from different users.

Functionality
The home page welcomes you with a welcome header and a "Users" button. Clicking this button will take you to the tweets page.

On the tweets page, you can view the number of tweets, followers and user avatar. In addition, you have the option to follow the user by clicking the "Follow" button. To return to your browser history, you can use the "Back" button.

User Filtering You can filter users based on their subscription status using three options:

Show all - displays all users
Follow - Displays users you are not following
Follow - displays the users you follow

Pagination Tweets are displayed in sets of three cards per page.

"Load more" button is available at the bottom of the user list. Clicking this button dynamically loads the next set of three cards.
